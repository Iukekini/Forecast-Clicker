# Forecast-Clicker

[Forecast Clicker Demo](https://iukekini.github.io/Forecast-Clicker)


## To Run

	Clone Repo
	Open forecast.html in any web browser (tested in chrome on mac)


## Known Issues

If you are going to run this on your own desktop you will need to replace the google maps api key with your own. This key is currently restricted to my local fie system and github domain.

## Features

* My Location to get the weather at your current location
* Location saving, when you reload the page it will show your last location
* Cache clearing, if you want to clear your cache and start fresh
* Click to get weather at any location
* Drag the marker to get weather at any location


### To Do List

The "My Location" button can be a little slow the first time you click it. A little loading screen could be added here so that the user doesn't this the application stalled. 


### 3rd Party References
* Bootstrap 4
* Jquery
* Awesome Font Icons 
* Google MAPS API
* Open Weather Map

## Inital Instructions
Your assignment is to create an app that displays a map.  When you click on the map the application uses
The latitude and longitude of the location of the mouse click to query a webservice to get local weather
information and display that information on the page.  You can use the resources to help you:
	
	Add map tutorial:
	https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map

	Current weather:
	http://openweathermap.org/current

	Jquery ajax:
	http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/

Or you can do your own thing and make the app work with other tools, but it must be able to run in the browser
without any additional libriaries to be downloaded.  If your solution requires multiple files, please zip them up.
